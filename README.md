student-picker
==============

A simple HTML5 app to quickly select random students who are present. 

This was inspired by my TA's use of what I believe he found here:

This version aims to add automatic configuration and support for  multiple class lists.

I've started with the initializr template located here: https://github.com/verekia/initializr-template
